[The App](https://thawing-ocean-46751.herokuapp.com/)

This is an express project for learning purposes. This is somewhat similar to the previous one, its because the project is mainly focused on implementing **CRUD** operations and my purpose was to practice more and get better at it.

*Practiced subjects and technologies:*  

Using a **MongoDB** free tier account.  
Connecting that and operating its **CRUD** operations with **Mongoose**  
**Pug** template language.
